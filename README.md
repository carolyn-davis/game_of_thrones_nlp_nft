## GOT Characters: Word Cloud Text Portraits for Lead Characters
This project was inspired by my interest in the book series written by George R.R. Martin, Game of Thrones. Script data from all eight seasons of the show will be utilized in order to generate text to portrait word clouds for all the characters in the series based off their most frequent word usage in various dialogues. The resulting Wordcloud character portraits will then be pushed to the NFT marketplace, OpenSea.
